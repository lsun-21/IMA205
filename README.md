Machine learning for image and object recognition

This course presents the main machine learning techniques for image analysis. More precisely :

- Introduction to unsupervised learning ("curse of dimensionality", ACP, ACI, NNMF)
- Introduction to supervised learning (overfitting, OLS, Ridge, LASSO, LDA, QDA)
- SVM (Large Margin Separator)
- Decision trees and random forests
- Ensemblistic learning 
- Artificial neural networks (ANNs)
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
